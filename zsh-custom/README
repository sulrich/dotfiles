# overview

this is an attempt to make the shell appropriately morph to the environment that
it's being run.  host and platform specific elements should be loaded
approrpriately depending on the platform this is being run on. 


# os x

i disable the use of path_helper in /etc/zprofile and construct the $PATH
specifically it seems to _pre_ - pend itself to the $PATH which messes a lot of
stuff up.
